    # These are limited as much as possible. In most cases, users need to
    # declare these on their own (probably via go_repository rules generated
    # with 'gazelle update-repos -from_file=go.mod). There are several
    # reasons for this:
    #
    # * com_google_protobuf has its own dependency macro. We can't load
    #   the macro here.
    # * rules_proto also has a dependency macro. It's only needed by tests and
    #   by gogo_special_proto. Users will need to declare it anyway.
    # * org_golang_google_grpc has too many dependencies for us to maintain.
    # * In general, declaring dependencies here confuses users when they
    #   declare their own dependencies later. Bazel ignores these.
    # * Most proto repos are updated more frequently than rules_go, and
    #   we can't keep up.
